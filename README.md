# TSP

In this project, we are interested in implementing a simple version of the genetic algorithm to solve
the Travel Salesman Problem (TSP). This project will be carried out as part the master’s course
entitled “Introduction to computational science” (CPSC-5506). A literature review and some
extensions of the problem will be presented. Some numerical experiments will be performed and
commented.
